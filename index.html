                    <p>I can remember to curiosity penetrating my veins, the excitement I felt.</p>
                    <p>I remember smelling the new plastic and the aroma of new electronics before the last protective layer of clear coat has had a chance to completely dry on the circuit boards.</p>
                    <p>It was my first computer. A Commodore 64C. They called it the 64C because it had a mere 64 kilobytes of RAM. I was 8 years old. And ever since that day, I have never stepped away from her.</p>
                    <p>I would spend the majority of my life learning everything I could about how these amazing machines worked. That they literally were, each chip was etched onto a thin silicon wafer, each one designed by an engineering artist. Yet in this moment, my mind could only picture an empty gallery waiting for a curator to bring it to life. That’s when I knew I wanted to code and bring life to the machine.
